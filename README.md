- 👋 Hi, I’m Mohammed Hassan
- 👀 I’m interested in web developing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an open-source project that aims to use artificial intelligence for environmental conservation. This could involve creating predictive models for climate change, developing intelligent systems for waste management, or using machine learning to study wildlife patterns. It’s a field where technology and nature intersect, and there’s a lot of potential for meaningful impact. 🌍💻
